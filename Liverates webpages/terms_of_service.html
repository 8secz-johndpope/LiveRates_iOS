            <p class="mbr-text py-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">The following Terms of Use and End User License Agreement (“EULA”) constitute an agreement between you (“You”) and The Developer (Aruna Sairam Manjunatha), City Rd, Chippendale, NSW 2008, Australia, governing the use of the software applications downloaded through Apple App Store (the “Licensed Application(s)”). Questions, complaints or claims with respect to the Licensed Application should be directed to arunasairammanjunatha@gmail.com.<br><br>You acknowledge and accept that (i) the previsions of this EULA shall not be deemed to set an agreement between You and Apple (or its subsidiaries) in any manner whatsoever and (ii) Apple and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this EULA, therefore Apple and its subsidiaries shall have the right and are deemed to have accepted the right to enforce this EULA against You as a third party beneficiary thereof.<br><br>Please consider that the Licensed Application are licensed, not sold, to You for use only under the terms of this EULA, unless the same are accompanied by a different license agreement, in which case the terms of that different license agreement will govern the relationship between You and the Application Provider, subject to Your prior acceptance of that separate license agreement. The Application Provider reserves all rights not expressly granted to You hereinafter.<br><br>Application Provider may update the Licensed Application and/or the Services and/or this EULA from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. In such a case, Application Provider will take appropriate measures to inform You via the Licensed Application or the Services or otherwise, in accordance with the significance of the changes Application Provider makes. By continuing to access or use the Licensed Application and/or Services after updates become effective, You agree to be bound by the updated EULA.<br><br>a. Scope of License<br><br>According to this EULA, the Application Provider grants you with a non-transferable license to use for both personal and commercial use the Licensed Application on any Apple iOS device that You own or control and in accordance with all applicable laws and Apple’s Usage Rules. This license does not allow You to use the Licensed Application on any Apple iOS device that You do not own or control.<br><br>You may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time, except that such Licensed Application may be accessed and used by other accounts associated with You via Apple Family Sharing.<br><br>You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this license and Apple’s Usage Rules), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open sourced components included with the Licensed Application). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of the Application Provider and its licensors, if any. If You breach this restriction, You may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the license will govern any upgrades provided by Application Provider that replace and/or supplement the Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license shall prevail over this EULA.&nbsp;<br><br>You acknowledge and accept to comply with applicable third party terms of agreement related to the use of the Licensed Application.<br><br>b. Consent to Use of Data<br><br>You agree that Application Provider may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about Your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to You (if any) related to the Licensed Application.<br><br>All data treated by the Application Provider shall be in compliance with &nbsp;Application Provider’s &nbsp;terms of service, as linked on the Licensed Application’s App Store page.<br><br>Application Provider may use any information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify You, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to You.<br><br>c. Termination<br><br>This EULA shall commence on the date that you accept the same expressly or install or otherwise use the Licensed Application and shall end on the date of your disposal of the Licensed Application, save for earlier termination in accordance with this agreement. It is understood that the validity of this EULA and the validity of any purchase associated to the Licensed Application shall be construed independently from each other, this meaning that (i) the termination of such associated purchase shall not affect the validity of this EULA and (ii) the termination of this EULA shall not affect the validity of such associated purchase.<br><br>Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from the Application Provider if You attempt to circumvent any technical protection measures used in connection with the Licensed Application and/or Services or you otherwise use the Licensed Application and/or Services in breach of the terms of this EULA. Upon termination of the license, You shall cease all use of the Licensed Application, and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Licensed Application.<br><br>d. Services and Third Party Materials<br><br>The Licensed Application may enable access to Application Provider’s and third party services and web sites (collectively and individually, "Services").
